# Sonogram Comparison

## Here is a notebook that plots sonograms/mel sonograms of 2 distinct species that I recorded in Da Nang within a week in December 2024. 

The first is the Taphozous - I discovered a roost of about 200 bats in the Marble Mountains, and successfully identified them as Chiroptera Taphozous.

The second one I recorded from my window of my apartment. At the time of writing this I am not sure what the breed is. So for the time being I'll refer to it as Chiroptera ATP. ATP is the name of my condominium.

Both recordings are echolocation calls. You can appreciate how vastly different they are when plotted. For the Taphozous, one recording is at 0.1 of original speed, and the second is at 0.25. ATP is at 0.1.

Additionally, I added a recording from xeno-canto of a related species, Taphozous Mauritanius.

### Notes and observations

Taphozous bats will be all out in good weather, and about 1/3 will stay in the roost if it is windy or rainy. Also, they will not leave if the roost is occupied with any significant number of people. They also tend to change exit routes and feeding spots, but hang out around the same area.

ATP Bats are interesting. The earliest I have seen them emerge was 5 PM, it was not dark yet, but I saw them circling around over a big tree not so far away. I've recorded them as early as 6 pm up to 9 pm. I saw and recorded them in a light drizzle, but failed to do so in heavy rain. Their frequencies are double that of Taphozous, ranging from 35 - 50 kHz. It is interesting that this is an urban area, and they still feel comfortable to hang out and forage around these buildings. I am yet to snap a picture but I am going to.
