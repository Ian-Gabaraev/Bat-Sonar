# Sonogram Comparison

## Here is a notebook that plots sonograms/mel sonograms of 2 distinct species that I recorded in Da Nang within a week in December 2024. 

The first is the Taphozous - I discovered a roost of about 200 bats in the Marble Mountains, and successfully identified them as Chiroptera Taphozous.

The second one I recorded from my window of my apartment. At the time of writing this I am not sure what the breed is. So for the time being I'll refer to it as Chiroptera ATP. ATP is the name of my condominium.

Both recordings are echolocation calls. You can appreciate how vastly different they are when plotted. For the Taphozous, one recording is at 0.1 of original speed, and the second is at 0.25. ATP is at 0.1.

Additionally, I added a recording from xeno-canto of a related species, Taphozous Mauritanius.
