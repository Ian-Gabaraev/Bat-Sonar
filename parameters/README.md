# Parameters of the Neural Network

## This is an interesting and fundamental point of this project's development. I have to establish the very nature of data I will be feeding the model.

### Main features
- Sonograms
- Oscillograms
- Power spectra
- Mel spectrograms

### Auxiliary features
- Location
- Time of the day
- Max and Min frequency
- Duration of a call

### Challenges
- Real-time vs time-stretched
- Overlapping calls
- Echo
- Background noise


## Main features
Let's dive into each option.

## Auxiliary features
Let's consider why any of these can be helpful.
