# Spotting Prediction

## Based on my fieldwork and daily observations of bat activity, develop a model to predict the likelihood of bat encounter in DaNang at any moment.

## Possible algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees (?)

## Input features ($\vec{x}$)
- Date
- Time
- Weather (Rain vs No Rain)
- Weather (Windy vs Not Windy)
- Human Disturbance (Binary)
- Temperature (Possibly)

## Output ($\hat{y}$)
- A value between 0 or 1, where 0 is no chance of bat activity, 1 is maximum chance of bat activity.
